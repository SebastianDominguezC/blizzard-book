# Overview

The Blizzard proyect is a solution to building multiplayer games in an authorative client-server architecture. This proyect consists of a [Server](./server.md) and a [Game Engine](./engine.md).

The proyect is still in development and very new, it is not a full-featured solution. As of now only the following are covered:

- ECS Game Engine (only data, no rendering)
- TCP authorative server
- Handling connections + disconnections
- Example client

There are many areas of improvement and for further development. The development roadmap can be seen in the next section!
