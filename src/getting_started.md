# Getting Started

For a quick setup and seeing the game engine and server work together, try copying the example library in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SebastianDominguezC/blizzard). It is a library with two binaries, one for the server and one for the client example.

For now, there is not a quick "default" way to get started, because the Game and World need to be manually configured, so please see the [learn](./learn.md) section!
