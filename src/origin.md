# Origin

This proyect started as my curiosity to develop a multiplayer game. I ended up deciding to write my own game server using Rust. After some succesfull connections and data passing between threads, I realised that the server needed a game engine in order to implement an authorative client-server achitecture. This gave birth to the Blizzard Game Engine and Server Engine! If you are curious about my learning process and development process, please see the [development process section](./dev_process.md).
